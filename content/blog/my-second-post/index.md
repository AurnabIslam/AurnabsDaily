After the post about wordpress i'm looking new topic to discuss.

i was thinking lets talk about **React**. As react has become one of
the most used as it is used for building user interfaces specifically
for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer 
for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI 
components.
